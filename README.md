# Web-Design-Challenge

Excercising HTML and CSS skills by creating a web based visualization dashboard. Publishing graphs/plots created using API data sources derived from the Python-API-Challenge, built this web design containing individual pages for each plot and integrate interactive navigation options between the pages. These pages consist of a dashboard landing page which can be accessed by clicking the Atlantis logo button located in the top left corner of each page throughout the website, the comparisons page which contains all of the plots in one page for easy outcome comparisons, and the data page containing the raw data points used for graphical analysis(plotting). In addition analysis summaries for each research category can be accessed from the landing page dashboard or by making a selection from the visualizations drop down menu. These pages are designed for interaction with user friendly drop downs/toggles, also the navigation bar will highlight the active page and display will adjust to various screen sizes providing responsiveness for viewing pleasure on PC's, Tablets, and Mobile devices.
