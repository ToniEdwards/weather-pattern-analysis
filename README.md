# Web-Design-Challenge
Web Dashboard Design
Excercising HTML and CSS skills by creating a web based visualization dashboard website using charts/graphs we've created in the Python-API-Challenge.
In building this Web design, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding analysis summaries. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and a data page where we can view the raw data points used to perform the analysis and build the visualizations.
